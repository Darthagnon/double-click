# double-click
AutoHotKey script merger: double-click Windows Explorer to go up a folder level, double-click Desktop to toggle your icons.

[Stardock WindowFX](https://www.stardock.com/products/windowfx/) and [Stardock Fences](https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/) both offer the option to hide your desktop icons when you double-click the desktop. Both of those softwares are good, but a bit overkill if you just want to toggle your desktop icons.

[Ejie Clover](http://en.ejie.me/) adds Chromium 54-style tabs to Windows Explorer, and a "double-click to go up a folder level" function. It is glitchy Chinese software (if you want to use it, I recommend [this repack by ElChupacabra, which is up-to-date and uses an English-language installer](https://lrepacks.ru/repaki-sistemnyh-programm/385-clover-repack-amp-portable.html)). I currently use [NurgoSoftware's TidyTabs](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/tidytabs), as it works a lot better with multiple windows than does Clover. It doesn't have a double-click to go up a folder level function, though.

That's where this Autohotkey script comes in, merging multiple existing sources to create one double-click script. When you double-click blank space in Windows Explorer, it will send you up a folder level. When you double-click your desktop, you will toggle the visibility of the mess you left there. Enjoy, and live long and prosper!
